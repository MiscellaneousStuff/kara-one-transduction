# Kara One Dataset - Transduction

## About

Assessing the feasibility of applying SOTA sEMG silent speech transduction methods to EEG speech synthesis.

## Kara One

Dataset combines 3 modalities (EEG, face tracking, audio) during imagined and
vocalised phonemic and single-word prompts.

## Dataset Details

### Epochs

EEG epoching is a procedure where specific time-windows are extracted
from a continuous EEG signal. These time windows are called "epochs"
and are usually time-locked with respect to an event, e.g. a visual stimulus
or in the case of this dataset, imagined speech.
